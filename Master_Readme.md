# **Congratulations and Welcome!**

Dear Candidate,

First of all, congratulations and thank you for accepting this challenge. Please read this document to its entirety before starting any project.

You are among a select few who have been given this opportunity, and we are truly excited to see what you will build. 

We understand that the scope of any of above project within the given time frame is demanding. However, we want to clarify that this is not because we do not value your time or effort; rather, it is because we are looking for someone extraordinary—someone who thrives under pressure, thinks critically, and delivers well-thought-out solutions even in challenging circumstances.

This project is not just about technical skills; it is a reflection of qualities like determination, problem-solving, time management, and the ability to persevere. These are the attributes we believe are essential for success in the role we are hiring for.

## **Implementation Guidelines**

We want to assure you that we are flexible with the architecture you choose to implement(for applicable roles) as long as you follow the **MVC architecture** (optinal, for backend tasks, if it makes you slow but come up with reasoning why you opt for something else). For frontend, we do want you to use NextJS.

To make it easier, you can start by cloning one of the following boilerplate repositories:

### **Node.js/Express/Next.js**
- Clone this repository: [Node.js/Express/Next.js Boilerplate](https://github.com/nishanprime/NextJSNodeJSDockerNginxBoilerPlate.git)

### **Flask**
- Clone this repository: [Flask MVC Boilerplate](https://github.com/nishanprime/FlaskMVCSetup.git)

### **Preference**:
- For backend roles, while we would prefer the **Node.js/Express/Next.js** setup, we are open to you using **Flask** if you believe the implementation would be better suited for the project. If you choose Flask, provide reasoning for your decision—it will help us understand your thought process.

- Additionally, if you need parts of the **Next.js/Node.js** boilerplate while working with Flask, feel free to clone both repositories and utilize whatever is necessary.

- For Frontend roles, we would prefer you to use **Next.js**.

- For DevOps roles, we would want you to make use of:
1. Docker
2. Nginx
3. Github Actions for CI/CD
4. Any Ubuntu based server for deployment
5. Let's Encrypt for SSL
6. PM2 for process management or any other process manager
7. Any other tools you think are necessary

You can use any of these VPS provider to get free VPS to get started:
1. https://gratisvps.net/cvps/
2. https://vpswala.org/free-vps-no-credit-card.html

Or any other VPS provider you are comfortable with.

## **A Unique Opportunity**

Rest assured, this challenge is not just a test; it’s an introduction to the kind of work culture you can expect here—a culture like no other in Nepal. We are building something exceptional, a workplace that fosters innovation, collaboration, and growth at a level rarely seen before. If you manage to pull this off, you will not just have the opportunity to join a team—you will become part of a transformative journey, one where your contributions will have real impact and where you will thrive in an environment designed to bring out the best in you.

We are rooting for your success, and we can’t wait to see your solution!

## **Time Tracking Instructions**

As part of this project, we kindly request you to **self-report the time you spend** on each task. This approach relies on **honesty and transparency**, which are qualities we highly value and will consider during the evaluation process and the interview.

---

## **Why Time Tracking?**
We understand that different people work at different paces, and this is not about how fast you complete the project. Instead, this is about:
1. **Understanding your approach** to time management.
2. **Seeing how you prioritize tasks** within the given timeframe.
3. **Getting insight into your problem-solving process.**

---

## **What to Track**
Please maintain a simple log that includes the following:
- **Date**: The day you worked on the project.
- **Time Spent**: How many hours you worked (approximately).
- **Task Description**: A brief description of what you worked on during that time.

---

## **Example Time Log**
| Date       | Time Spent (hrs) | Task Description                         |
|------------|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 2024-11-28 | 3                | Implemented Ticket Locking               |
| 2024-11-29 | 4                | Integrated Stripe Checkout               |
| 2024-11-29 | 2                | Implemented Context API etc |

---

## **Important Notes**
- **Honesty is key**: We trust you to report your time accurately. This will be considered during your evaluation and interview.
- **It's not about speed**: We are looking for thoughtful implementation and prioritization, not rushing through tasks just for the sake of completion.
- **Doesn't mean we don't value fast work**: While we appreciate thoughtful work, we also value efficiency. If you can complete the project quickly without compromising quality, that's a plus.
- **Document thoroughly**: The quality of your self-reporting reflects on your ability to work transparently and methodically.
