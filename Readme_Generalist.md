# **Generalist Developer Assessment: Research, Build, and Document**

---

## **Objective**

This challenge evaluates your ability to:
1. **Research and implement a combination of new technologies** from the provided list.
2. **Build a functional application or tool** using these technologies.
3. **Document your process and implementation in detail**, focusing on your thought process, challenges, and learnings.

---

## **Project Overview**

### **What You Need to Do**
1. Choose a **combination of technologies** from the provided list below.
2. Build **a functional application (any, of your choice but with tech mentioned below)** showcasing the integration of these technologies.
3. Provide **comprehensive documentation**:
   - Why did you choose these technologies?
   - How did you integrate them?
   - Challenges faced and how you overcame them.
   - Step-by-step instructions for running the project locally and in production.

### **Focus on Documentation**
The most important part of this challenge is **clear and detailed documentation**. Your documentation should enable someone to understand your project, your choices, and how to replicate your setup.

## **Suggested Combinations**

### **Frontend + Backend**
1. **React Flow + GraphQL Apollo Server**:
   - Build an interactive flowchart where data is fetched and updated via GraphQL.
2. **React DND + tRPC**:
   - Create a drag-and-drop task manager with real-time updates using tRPC.

### **Fullstack**
3. **React Flow + Redis Streams**:
   - Build a real-time workflow diagram with live updates powered by Redis Streams.
4. **Supabase + Framer Motion**:
   - Build a user authentication system with Supabase and add polished animations using Framer Motion.

### **AI/ML Integration**
5. **LangChain + Kafka**:
   - Build a document processing pipeline where Kafka manages document ingestion, and LangChain summarizes them.
6. **Autogen + React Flow**:
   - Create an automated workflow generator where users define workflows, and Autogen executes them with AI agents.

### **DevOps + Fullstack**
7. **Kubernetes + Supabase**:
   - Deploy a scalable Supabase-backed application on Kubernetes.
8. **Terraform + Docker + Redis Streams**:
   - Use Terraform to manage infrastructure for a Dockerized application that streams real-time data via Redis.
   - 
   
### **Note**: Above mentioned suggestions are not the only exact things you should build. Make use of tech mentioned above and feel free to build anything you wish. Just make sure to document it well and be able to justify it as mentioned above.

## **Deliverables**

### **1. GitHub Repository**
- Push your project code to a **public GitHub repository** with:
  - A clear `README.md` file.
  - Well-structured and documented code.

### **2. Documentation**
Your documentation is critical. Include:
1. **Project Overview**:
   - What the project does and why you built it.
   - The combination of technologies you chose and why.
2. **Research Process**:
   - Key learnings about each technology.
   - Challenges faced and how you solved them.
3. **Implementation**:
   - A step-by-step walkthrough of how you integrated the chosen technologies.
   - Include code snippets where helpful.
4. **Setup Instructions**:
   - **Local Setup**: Detailed steps for running the project locally.
   - **Production Setup**: How you deployed the application.
5. **API Documentation** (if applicable):
   - Include endpoints, request/response examples, and any necessary setup instructions.
6. **Future Improvements**:
   - Ideas for extending the project.

### **3. Live Demo**
- Deploy your project to a cloud platform (e.g., Vercel, AWS, Netlify).
- Provide a **public URL** to access the live demo.
- Also note, we still need to know how to replicate it locally.

## **Evaluation Criteria**

1. **Documentation**:
   - Is your documentation clear, detailed, and professional?
   - Does it provide a thorough walkthrough of your research and implementation?

2. **Research and Understanding**:
   - How well did you understand and implement the chosen technologies?
   - Are your design and technology choices justified?

3. **Functionality**:
   - Is the application/tool working as intended?
   - Are APIs functional and well-documented?

4. **Creativity**:
   - Is the project unique or innovative?
   - Does it showcase your ability to think creatively?

5. **Code Quality**:
   - Is the code clean, modular, and maintainable?
   - Are best practices followed?

---

---

## **Stretch Goals** (Optional)
- Add **real-time features** or **advanced UI/UX enhancements**.
- Set up a **CI/CD pipeline** to automate testing and deployment.
- Use **monitoring tools** (e.g., Grafana, Prometheus) for application performance.

---

## **Good Luck!**

Weâ€™re excited to see how you combine technologies, research, and document your journey. Remember, this challenge is about showcasing your **ability to learn, adapt, and deliver**. Focus on creating a well-documented and functional project.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
